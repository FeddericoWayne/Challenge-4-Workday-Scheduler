# Challenge 2: Code Quiz

## Description

This is a cute little pop quiz App to test the user's basic JavaScript knowledge!

When the page loads, the rules of the quiz is displayed. Once the user clicks on the Start Quiz button, the first qustion will be displayed, followed by four options for the user to choose from and click on, while a countdown starts from 90 seconds. Once the user clicks on an option, they will be shown the next question, and their score will be updated accordingly. There's also color and sound indicators to let the user know if they've answered the previous question correctly. For each correct answer, 5 points will be added to the user's score. For each incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be subtracted from the countdown. If the user answers all 20 questions before the 90-second countdown ends, they will get a congratulatory message and will be asked to enter their initials for the score board. Once the user's initials are entered, the score board will display, which includes the initials and scores of previous users who also finished the 20 questions within 90 seconds. The user then will get two buttons below the score board- a Clean Board button (whick wipes the score board clean), and a Try Again button (which will refresh the App for the user to take the quiz again). If the 90 second ends before the user is able to finish all 20 questions, they will get a sad message and sound effect and will not be prompted to enter their initials for the score board, and will instead be given the Try Again button). 

At the very bottom of the App the user can toggle between light mode and dark mode, and the color scheme of the page will transition accordingly (with sound effects, too!)

This App is made for both larger and smaller viewports.
